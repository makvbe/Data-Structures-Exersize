The driver class should be a menu driven class that allows the user to input a string from a text file which may be quite a few lines long, tokenize the string, display the tokens, translate the tokens into Pig Latin, and display the result using ToString from the PigLatin class to format the results.  The user should be able input, translate, and display strings from other text files, but it is not necessary for the program to work with more than one text file at a time.
